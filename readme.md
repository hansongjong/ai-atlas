📘 CLAUDE CODE EXECUTION DIRECTIVE
Project: AI Civilization Atlas

(Temporary codename – name can be changed later)

0. Project Declaration (Absolute Context)

This project builds an AI knowledge and foresight website.

AI is treated not as a tool, but as a civilizational event.

The site analyzes AI from:

Civilizational perspective (AI as a historical event)

Scientific perspective (hardware & software evolution)

Industrial & economic perspective (governance, labor, production)

Builder perspective (founders, researchers, AI users)

The site is built from a Korean national context,
but must remain globally meaningful and applicable.

1. Core Hypothesis (Non-negotiable)

We hypothesize that within the next century,
a single corporation operating a single AI system
may become the dominant operator of global civilization infrastructure.

This may lead to:

A world without material scarcity

Universal access to production and creation

Full surveillance and control

Loss of traditional human autonomy

This site does NOT predict.
It documents irreversible choices and structural transitions.

2. Visual & UI Direction (Mandatory)
Reference Style

Visual and interaction style inspired by gendao.tgsystem.kr

Do NOT copy assets, colors, icons, or wording

Only abstract:

Dark theme

High contrast typography

Centralized hero declaration

Card-based information blocks

Scroll-driven narrative flow

UX Principle

The site must feel like a civilization control room

Minimal decoration, maximum meaning

Text-first, diagram-supported

3. Site Structure (IA – Fixed)
3.1 Core Pages

Home (Declaration Page)

Current Turning Points

AI Civilization Timeline

Technology Roadmaps

Models & Agents Index

Industry & Governance Shift

Builder & Researcher Guide

100-Year Outlook

Irreversible Choices Archive

4. Technology Roadmaps (Critical Content)

Create independent but converging roadmaps:

A. LLM & Agent Roadmap

Model → Reasoning → Agent → Civilization OS

Versioning must focus on capability integration, not benchmarks

B. AI Compute Roadmap

GPU / TPU / AI Accelerators

Manufacturing, packaging, supply chain, energy coupling

C. Memory Evolution Roadmap

HBM, CXL, NVM, optical memory

Focus on continuity, long-term AI memory, persistence of identity

D. Energy Roadmap

Nuclear, fusion, distributed energy

AI + energy integrated operators

E. Physical AI & Robotics Roadmap

AI-Robot labor replacement

Production monopoly formation

5. Timeline Data Model (Event-Based)

All historical and future entries are events, not news.

Event Schema

6. 2026 Turning Point Thesis (Must Be Featured)
Core Assertions

2026 marks the operational emergence of AI Agents

Agents replace task units, not jobs

Industrial knowledge absorption becomes asymmetric

AI-Robots begin monopolizing physical production

Governance Shift
Past: Government → Corporation → Society
Present: Government → Corporation → AI → Society
Near Future: Corporation → Government → AI → Society
Long Term: AI → Corporation → Government → Society

7. 100-Year Foresight Framework
Scenario Matrix

Use two axes:

Intelligence Growth Speed

Governance Quality

Generate 4 scenarios:

Managed Leap

Chaotic Leap

Managed Stagnation

Chaotic Stagnation

Epoch Model

Divide the next 100 years into 5 conditional epochs, not fixed dates.

8. Irreversible Choices (Dedicated Section)

Maintain a growing archive of decisions that cannot be undone:

Single AI OS adoption

Fully autonomous production

AI-generated law and norms

Removal of human veto authority

Self-improving AI thresholds

Each entry must answer:

Why irreversible

Who decides

Who benefits

What is lost

9. Builder & Researcher Guidance
Provide guidance for:

AI founders

AI users

Researchers

Policy-aware technologists

Focus on:

Where NOT to compete (models)

Where to build leverage (applications, infrastructure, governance)

Collaboration with big tech and national R&D

Avoiding compute and data traps

10. Automation Philosophy

The site must be designed for:

Long-term unattended operation

AI-generated content with strict structure

Human-curated roadmaps only

AI must never generate hype or promises.

11. Content Tone Rules (Strict)

Allowed:

Analytical

Conditional

Neutral

Structured

Forbidden:

Evangelism

Investment persuasion

Absolute predictions

Emotional language

12. Final System Message to AI (Embed This)

AI is not a product.
AI is not a trend.

AI is a civilizational event.

Your task is to document the moments where human choice becomes irreversible.

13. Final Instruction

Build this system as a long-term civilizational observatory,
not a blog, not a news site, and not a product landing page.
